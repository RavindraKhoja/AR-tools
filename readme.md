### 1. AR tools
`artools.py` is a collection of Python functions for carrying out AR calculations as well as performing simple 2-D and 3-D visualisations of convex regions. A Jupyter notebook demonstrating its usage is given in the [notebooks folder](./AR-book/AR-book-notebooks/Ch%208/artools%20demos.ipynb).

Currently, `artools.py` is written in Python 2.

Jupyter notebooks can be found [here](./AR-book/AR-book-notebooks) that help to demonstrate a number of common AR theory concepts. These notebooks are written in conjunction with the [attainable region theory textbook](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119157889.html).

### 3. AR website examples
The source code for the examples described on attainableregions.com are also stored [here](./AR-book/website-examples).
