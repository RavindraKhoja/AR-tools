    "The stoichiometric subspace is a region in concentration space wherein all feasible concentrations must lie.  It forms the upper bounds in concentration space in which the true attainable region must lie. This region originates from the feed point and it must obey reaction stoichiometry. Thus, it is typically much larger than the set of 'attainable' points. For n components participating in d reactions, the true AR must reside in a d-dimensional subspace in $R^n$. And, it follows that the dimension d, is the number of linearly independent reactions (rank(A)) present in a system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any specified feed vector $(C_f)$ and extent of reaction $(\\varepsilon)$, the set of stoichiometrically compatible concentrations must lie within a region spanned by the feed vector and stoichiometric coefficient $(A)$ vector in concentration space. As a consequence of the physical meaning of achievable concentrations, mass balance and non-negativity constraints are imposed, further restricting the set of physically attainable concentrations. This implies that every point $c_i$ within the stoichiometric subspace must reside in the positive orthant of the 'real' concentration space. Furthermore, it must be stoichiometrically compatible with the given reaction stoichiometry. \n",

    "The stoichiometric subspace is denoted by the letter S and it obeys the following vector equation parameterized by the extent of reaction;\n",

    "Computing a stoichiometric subspace for a single feed is done by identifying the bounding constraints in extent space that form the stoichiometric subspace. Vertex enumeration is employed to find the extreme vertices in extent space that constitute the feasible region. Consequently, finding the vertices of the convex polytope, S, in $R^n$ i.e. computing the convex hull of the stoichiometric subspace polytope described by the inequality constraints;\n",

    "The ` con2vert()` function in the `artools package` is deployed in solving the vertex enumeration problem. Since the stoichiometric subspace is a function of both the reaction stoichiometry and the feed point, thus, the shape of the stoichiometric subspace will change if the feed point is changed. This implies that each feed point has an associated stoichiometrci subspace, S. Hence, it can be deduced that; the set of concentrations belonging to the overall stoichiometric subspace, $S_{tot}$, may be found by computing convex hull of the individual stoichiometric subspaces;\n",
