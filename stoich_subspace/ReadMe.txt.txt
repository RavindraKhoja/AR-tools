Currently, stoich_subspace() is broken and needs to be adapted to accept multiple feeds. This should be simple (in principle) as we just need to loop through and compute the stoichiometric subspace for all N feeds as an input to the function. We then compute the convex hull of all N stoichiometric subspaces. 

stoich_subspace() should also return the stoichiometric subspace (in both concentration or extent format) corresponding to the individual feeds.
